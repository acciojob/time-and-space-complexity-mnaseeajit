	<h1>Time , Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity quantifies the execution time of an algorithm concerning input size, while efficiency encompasses various aspects, including time and space usage, optimization techniques, and scalability, to ensure algorithms perform well in practical scenarios.</p>
    <p>In <b>space complexity</b> notation O(n), the amount of memory used by an algorithm grows linearly with the input size (n). It means that if the input size increases, the memory used by the algorithm also increases proportionally. Algorithms with O(n) space complexity store data in a way that directly correlates with the input size. While linear space complexity indicates a direct relationship between input size and memory usage, it's generally considered more efficient than higher-order complexities (such as O(n^2) or O(2^n)) but less efficient than constant space complexity (O(1)). Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space complexity, especially for large datasets, to optimize memory usage.</p>
